# AHK-workspace
Being used to linux, I love to personnalise my environment to add some shortcuts and functionalities such as workspace scroll, hot corners, and more. Windows, on the other hand, doesn't natively allow such custom features. This repo is a set of scripts using AutoHotKkey (.ahk) to enhance your windows environment, introducing... the AHK Workspace!
